## Examples

Create a policy that allows access to write all parameters
```hcl
module "ps_policy" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store-policy-documents.git?ref=master"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "ps_write" {
  name_prefix   = "write_any_parameter_store_value"
  path   = "/"
  policy = "${module.ps_policy.write_parameter_store_policy}"
}
```

Create a policy that allows managing all policies
```hcl
module "ps_policy" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store-policy-documents.git?ref=master"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "ps_manage" {
  name_prefix   = "manage_any_parameter_store_value"
  path   = "/"
  policy = "${module.ps_policy.manage_parameter_store_policy}"
}
```

Create a policy that allows reading all parameters that start with a certain prefix
```hcl
module "ps_policy" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store-policy-documents.git?ref=master"
  parameter_root_name = "/cp/dev/app"

}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "ps_manage" {
  name_prefix   = "write_specific_parameter_store_value"
  path   = "/"
  policy = "${module.ps_policy.manage_parameter_store_policy}"
}
```

Create a kms policy to allow decrypting of the parameter store values
```hcl
module "kms_key" {
  source                  = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kms-key.git?ref=master"
  namespace               = "cp"
  stage                   = "prod"
  name                    = "app"
  description             = "KMS key"
  deletion_window_in_days = 10
  enable_key_rotation     = "true"
  alias                   = "alias/parameter_store_key"
}

module "ps_policy" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store-policy-documents.git?ref=master"
  parameter_root_name = "/cp/dev/app"
  kms_key             = "${module.kms_key.key_arn}"

}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "ps_kms" {
  name_prefix   = "decrypt_parameter_store_value"
  path   = "/"
  policy = "${module.ps_policy.manage_kms_store_policy}"
}
```

Create a policy for another account, or region
```hcl
module "ps_policy" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store-policy-documents.git?ref=master"
  parameter_root_name = "/cp/dev/app"
  account_id          = "783649272629220"
  region              = "ap-southeast-2"

}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "ps_manage" {
  name_prefix   = "manage_any_parameter_store_value"
  path   = "/"
  policy = "${module.ps_policy.manage_parameter_store_policy}"
}
```




## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| account_id | The account id of the parameter store you want to allow access to. If none supplied, it uses the current account id of the provider. | string | `` | no |
| kms_key | The arn of the KMS key that you want to allow access to. If empty it uses a wildcard resource (`*`). | string | `` | no |
| parameter_root_name | The prefix or root parameter that you want to allow access to. | string | `` | no |
| region | The region of the parameter store value that you want to allow access to. If none supplied, it uses the current region of the provider. | string | `` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| manage_kms_store_policy | A JSON policy document that allows decryption access to a KMS key. |
| manage_parameter_store_policy | A JSON policy document that allows full access to the parameter store. |
| put_xray_trace_policy | A JSON policy document that allows putting data into x-ray for tracing parameter store requests. |
| read_parameter_store_policy | A JSON policy document that only allows read access to the parameter store. |
| write_parameter_store_policy | A JSON policy document that only allows write access to the parameter store. |
